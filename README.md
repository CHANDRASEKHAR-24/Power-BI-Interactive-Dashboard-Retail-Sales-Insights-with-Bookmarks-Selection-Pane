✅ Why Use Them?
Feature	Purpose
Bookmarks	Save views/states of a report page for storytelling or navigation

✅ How I Used Them in This Dashboard:
Created button-triggered views using Bookmarks.

Enabled toggle between "Show Filters" and "Hide Filters" by:

Using two versions of the same filter panel (one visible, one hidden).

Bookmarking both states.

Buttons connected to Bookmarks.

Used the Selection Pane to control visibility of visuals like charts or slicers.

Improved report navigation with custom view control using bookmarks (e.g., category-wise deep dive).

📽️ The attached video shows a smooth transition between these views, making the dashboard feel like an app.
